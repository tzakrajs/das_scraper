das_scraper
===========

This script will allow you to download all of the DAS screencasts

You will need to update the constants USER_EMAIL and USER_PASSWORD

The URLs that you post to are built from:
DAS_BASE_URL='https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/'

There are no tests for this, it defines no classes or methods, it is almost antithetical to its mission. But heres to getting better :)

Usage:
/path/to/python-2.7 ./das_scraper.py

Requires BeautifulSoup and requests
